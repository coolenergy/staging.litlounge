          your use of the Platform, any such claims, including any private attorney-general
          representative claims, will be resolved by binding individual arbitration and not in
          court. There is no judge or jury in arbitration proceedings, and awards made by an
          arbitrator are not generally appealable in court except in rare circumstances. Arbitrators
          can, however, award damages on an individual basis identical to what can be awarded by a
          judge. An arbitrator hearing a claim is obligated to follow these Terms as a judge in a
          regular court proceeding would be. The United States Federal Arbitration Act and United
          States federal arbitration law apply to these Terms. To commence an arbitration
          proceeding, you must send a notice to us at legal@LitLounge.io. The arbitration will be
          conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules, including the
          Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes, and the Federal Arbitration Act.
          The AAA rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. Payment and fees
          for the arbitration are governed by the AAA rules. We will reimburse the arbitration
          filing fees for claims less than $1,000 except where the claims are ruled to be frivolous.
          The arbitration will be held in Los Angeles County, California. Neither party will be
          entitled to an award of its attorneys&#39; fees or costs incurred in arbitration, except
          where the court has ruled that the other party&#39;s claim is frivolous. <br /></span
